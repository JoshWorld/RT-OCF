# GOVERNANCE AND COMMUNITY

## Governance

In addition to developing under an open source license, RT-OCF uses an Open Source Project approach, welcoming everyone to participate, contribute, and engage with each other through the project.

The RT-OCF Open Source Project shall have its own governance rules, published on its infrastructure, specifying how work in the project happens. In specific, the governance rules specify:

- Decision-making;
- Conflict resolution and escalation of decisions;
- Positions of responsibility in the project;
- Process for updating the governance rules.
- Reviewing source code.

Updates to the Governance rules are subject to ratification by Steering Committee. The Steering Committee will verify that any updates to the governance rules are aligned with RT-OCF goals.

### Project Roles

RT-OCF recognizes the following formal roles:

**Technical Steering Committee**

Technical Steering Committee (TSC) guides the development of the open source implementation.
As such, TSC have the right to set the overall organization of the source code in the Module, and the right to participate in the decision-making of the Module. TSC are required to participate in the feature development process.

The Technical Steering Committee responsibilities are defined as:
- Oversee the health of the RT-OCF development community.
- Oversee and facilitate the development of the RT-OCF source code under the governance rules of the RT-OCF Open Source Project.
- Execute or participate in evaluation of competing open source implementations.

**Contributor**

A Contributor is anyone who submit CLA(Contributor License Agreement) and wishes to contribute to the project, at any level. Contributors are granted the following rights, to:
- Contribute code, documentation, translations, artwork, etc.;
- Report defects (bugs) and suggestions for enhancement;
- Participate in the process of reviewing contributions by others;
- Initiate and participate in discussions in the mailing lists;
- Approach any member of the community with matters they believe to be important.

### Decision-making in RT-OCF

The decision is made by the TSC following its own decision-making process

### Open Source License

The RT-OCF project is an open source project released under the terms of the Apache License version 2.0.

## Code Review

### Reviewing Guidelines

Code review can be performed by TSC.
TSC can review the code changes and share their opinion by comments.
Changes are submitted using pull request and only TSC as well.

### Review Times

The following steps are followed for the code review process.
* Changes should be reviewed in reasonable amount of time.
    * Three business days is considered reasonable.
* TSC should leave changes open for some time so others can offer feedback
    * Given time zones, one full business day is recommended
* Review times increase given complexity of the review
    * Large contributions will take a longer time to be reviewed and approved
    * Simple contributions may be reviewed and approved within hours or minutes

### Reviewing & Discussion Principles

* Discuss code, never the codeâ€™s author
* Respect and acknowledge contributions, suggestions, comments
* Listen and be open for all different opinions
* Help each other
